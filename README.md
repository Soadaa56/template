# Description

This will be a side project of making a website for my gf to show off her various creations.

The final project will use Ruby on Rails for the backend.

The rails part of this project will go into a different repo. I will be using this repo as a template to work off until I'm far along enough into the Ruby on Rails for [TOP]("https://www.theodinproject.com/") (The Odin Project).

Because I only have a surface level understanding of erb, I'm unsure how much help a template of a static website will be useful as a starting off point for my final rails project.

## Goals

* To allow users to make accounts and sign in.
I want to learn how to authenticate users and to show different html if people are signed in.

* Allow users to comment under creations(posts)
This will strengthen my ability to have comments in a database and reference them to posts and user histories (Active Records).

* Allow users to sign up to a newsletter
Although realistically I probably wouldn't support the feature of a monthly newsletter, but just to learn how things are setup.

* Allow users to send email to look into purchasing an item
I would want to setup a automated notification on my cellphone when receiving and email. I have no clue how to do this but I'm curious and shouldn't be too hard.

* To make the website look clean when viewed from mobile
I don't have any experience with making websites look good on mobile and this would a great time to learn. I imagine this website could a type of 'virtual' business card.

Realistically anyone my gf would like to show this website to would more than likely viewed from mobile. 

I'm curious how rails can show different html to desktop vs mobile (and maybe pad) users.
