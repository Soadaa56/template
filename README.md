#Description

This will be a side project of making a website for my gf to show off her various creations.

The final project will use Ruby on Rails for the backend and allow for users to sign up and comment on creations.

The rails side of this project will go into a different repo, but I will be using this repo as a template to work off until I'm far along enough into the Ruby on Rails for [TOP]("https://www.theodinproject.com/") (The Odin Project).

Because I only have a surface level understanding of erb, I'm unsure how much help a template of a static website will be as a starting off point for my final rails project.
